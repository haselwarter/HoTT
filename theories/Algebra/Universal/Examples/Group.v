Definition ModelAlgebraGroup : Type := ModelAlgebra equations_group.

(* Here I list some of the missing results for this file. Remember that univalence is an axiom, so try to use it only for h-props.
   1. Show that [ModelAlgebraGroup] is equivalent to [Group], [ModelAlgebraGroup <~> Group].
   2. Define group homomorphism and isomorphism, see HoTT.Algebra.Groups.Group. Show group homomorphism/isomorphism is equivalent to algebra homomorphism/isomorphism. If a function preserves multiplication, then it also preserves unit and inverse.
   3. Show that group isomorphism is equivalent to equality by applying [equiv_path_isomorphism] from HoTT.Algebra.Universal.Isomorphism.
   4. Define the product group and projection homomorphisms by using [model_prod_algebra].
   5. Prove the universal property for product group using that for [prod_algebra].
   6. Define subgroup as a [model_subalgebra] and the inclusion map using that for [subalgebra].
   7. Define group congruence using algebra congruence.
   8. Define quotient group (by a congruence) as a [model_quotient_algebra].
   9. Obtain the quotient map and universal property from that of [quotient_algebra].
   10. Prove the equivalence normal subgroup <~> group congruence, [fun N => (fun x y => x * -y âˆˆ N)] and [fun R => {x | R x mon_unit}].
   11. Define quotient group (by normal subgroup).
   12. Prove that the quotient by normal subgroup is equivalent to quotient by congruence, by using the equivalence between normal subgroup and congruence.
   13. Obtain the universal property for quotient by normal subgroup from that of quotient by congruence.
   14. Define the free group and universal property using [FreeAlgebra]. *)
